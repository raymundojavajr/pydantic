    "# 1. Introduction to Pydantic\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we’ll explore **Pydantic**, a powerful Python library for data validation and settings management using Python type hints. By the end of this section, you’ll understand the basics of Pydantic, why it’s useful for data-driven projects, and how to define and use simple models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 What is Pydantic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pydantic is a Python library that helps you:\n",
    "- **Define Data Schemas:** You specify exactly what data your program should expect.\n",
    "- **Validate Data:** It checks that your data matches the schema (e.g., that a name is a string, or an age is a positive integer).\n",
    "- **Automatically Convert Types:** If possible, Pydantic converts data into the correct type (e.g., turning `\"30\"` into `30`).\n",
    "- **Provide Clear Error Messages:** When data does not match the schema, Pydantic raises descriptive errors to help you quickly identify the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Why is Data Validation Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine building an ML model or an API that relies on data from various sources like files, databases, or external APIs. If the data doesn’t match your expected format, it can lead to:\n",
    "- **Bugs and Crashes:** Your code might fail unexpectedly when it encounters the wrong type of data.\n",
    "- **Poor Model Performance:** Training or inference on corrupted or inconsistent data can degrade model performance.\n",
    "- **Increased Debugging Time:** It’s much harder to track down issues when data errors occur deep within your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing Pydantic early in your data pipeline, you catch errors sooner, making your system more robust and easier to maintain. This is particularly important in MLOps, where ensuring data quality is key to model reliability and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 The Role of Type Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s type hints allow us to declare the expected type for each variable or function parameter. Pydantic leverages these hints to:\n",
    "- **Enforce Data Types:** For example, if a field is declared as a string, Pydantic will ensure that only strings (or convertible types) are accepted.\n",
    "- **Improve Code Readability:** Clear type hints make your code self-documenting, which is beneficial for collaboration and maintenance.\n",
    "- **Enable Autocompletion:** When using modern editors, type hints help with code suggestions, speeding up development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 A Simple Example: The Person Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start by creating a very basic data model. We’ll define a model to represent a person with just two fields: `name` and `age`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import the necessary component from Pydantic\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the Person model with two fields: name and age.\n",
    "class Person(BaseModel):\n",
    "    name: str  # Expecting a string for the name\n",
    "    age: int   # Expecting an integer for the age\n"
